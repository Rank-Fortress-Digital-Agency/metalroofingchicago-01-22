            <p>Metal roofing is durable and long-lasting, so you never have to worry about replacing it for decades.  And it’s environmentally friendly, so you can feel good about choosing metal roofing for your home. Read below to learn more about metal roofs and how they compare to other types of roofs.</p>
            <br>
            <div style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
                <ol>
                    <li>Metal Roofs are Durable</li><br>
                    <p>Metal roofs are widely known for being durable, but just how long do they last? Several studies have been conducted to find the answer.</p>
                    <p>Studies show that metal roofs can last 50 years or even longer! Over time, other types of roofs will need to be replaced because they lose their protective covering, but not metal roofs.</p><br>
                    <li>Metal Roofs are Environmentally Friendly</li><br>
                    <p>There are two features of metal roofing that make it an environmentally friendly roofing choice for your home.</p>
                    <p>The first is the protective covering that keeps rain and snow from damaging the roof itself. Metal roofs prevent water damage to your home’s structure, preventing costly repairs and replacements.</p>
                    <p>The second feature of metal roofs that makes them environmentally friendly is their recycling ability. Metal roofs can be melted down and recycled into new metal roofs at the end of their life cycle, making them a truly sustainable green roofing option.</p><br>
                    <li>Energy Savings with Metal Roofs</li><br>
                    <p>Metal roofs reduce energy costs to keep your home comfortable throughout the year because they reflect much of the sun’s heat away from the building – up to 80%! This reduces cooling needs during hot summer months and keeps heat from seeping inside during cold winter months.</p>
                    <p>The metal roofing industry has recognized this benefit and offers a Metal Roof Energy Saver Rebate Program to give homeowners up to $1,000 back when they purchase and install metal roofs.</p><br>
                    <li>Affordable Metal Roofs Are Available</li><br>
                    <p>Metal roofing is an affordable option for your home’s exterior because it lasts so long that you don’t have to worry about needing any repairs or replacement for decades. The 50+ year lifespan of most metal roofs is longer than the average lifespan of other types of roofs, making them more cost-efficient.</p>
                    <p>And there are several types of metal roofing available at different price points and with varying levels of impact on the environment – meaning you can find a metal roof that fits your budget and reflects your style.</p><br>
                    <li>Metal Roofs Come in Several Styles & Colors</li><br>
                    <p>From traditional black to bold red, there’s a metal roof that will look good with your home’s exterior while reflecting heat and keeping it cool.</p>
                    <p>And some types of metal roofs overlap each other without seams to give you more design options for the structure and appearance of your roof.</p>
                    <p>The color, material type, and amount of light reflected by your metal roof also help determine its environmental impact. You can find all these styles and color options at most building supply stores or get a custom-built metal roof made specifically for your home from an experienced contractor near you!</p>

            <h2>How Metal Roofs Work</h2>
            <p>Metal roofs work differently than traditional asphalt shingle roofs.  Most asphalt shingles are made of felt paper with an asphalt coating to create water resistance.  Asphalt is not very durable, but it is very inexpensive and easy to install. Unfortunately, these roofs have a relatively short lifespan because the adhesive used to bond the layers together breaks down over time.</p>
            <p>Asphalt shingles have a lifespan of about 25 years – if you’re lucky – so homeowners have to spend thousands every decade or so just to keep their roofs intact.</p>
            <p>Metal roofs, on the other hand, are made of interlocking panels that are bent into shape. Metal roofs can be installed in less than one day and they come with a warranty of up to 50 years.  This means you won’t have to spend thousands every decade or so just to keep your roof intact. Instead, you’ll have to spend thousands every half-century!  If you live somewhere where it snows in the wintertime, having a metal snow roof is even better because snow weighs approximately 12 pounds per cubic foot. Snow will easily slide right off your roof instead of being forced under shingles by wind gusts – which might eventually cause leaks inside your house.</p>

                    <h2>Climates Where Metal Roofs Thrive</h2>
                    <p>As we’ve already mentioned, metal roofs live for a very long time.  There is some debate over just how long they will last in different climates, but most estimates say that metal roofs can survive about 80-90 years in snowy, icy regions and about 70-80 years in sunny hot areas.</p>
                    <p>Metal roofs are built to last so you won’t need to replace them as often as traditional asphalt shingle roofs, but there are still many factors that contribute to their lifespan. For example, Metal roofs might not do well if they don’t receive enough sunlight because paneling needs radiation from the sun to dry out the inside of the roof over time. If water isn’t allowed to escape through evaporation then it could pool underneath your roof and start to cause problems.</p>
                    <p>Metal roofs are a great choice for homeowners who live in snowy regions or sunny areas with high heat, but they might not be right for people living somewhere where it snows only occasionally or somewhere that experiences freezing temperatures year-round.  Additionally, metal roofs can become very hot during warm weather so if you’re planning on putting your roofing panels in direct sunlight then you should consider installing an overhang to protect them from the elements.</p>

            <h2>A metal roof is an investment in your home's future.</h2>
            <p>It is also an investment that will save you money throughout the years. Metal roofing provides numerous benefits for your home, including improved energy efficiency and reduced interior noise levels, which can help your HVAC system to run more efficiently.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Energy Efficiency</h2>
            <p>The installation of metal roofs over traditional asphalt shingles will increase the R-value of your entire roof system, making it much more difficult for heat to escape in the summer months. This means that heating and cooling costs will be lower than they would be with other types of roofing materials.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Durability / Longevity</h2>
            <p>Metal material has extremely good weather resistance properties, making it a great choice due to its ability to handle harsh climates. Another major benefit is that when installed properly, a metal roof can last up to 50 years or more.</p>
            <h2>Noise Reduction</h2>
            <p>Metal roofs are great at dampening noise that usually penetrates your home through the ceiling. This is due to the mass of the material and its ability to absorb it without transferring it inside where you live. Metal roofs also help make homes quieter by deflecting wind over them versus traditional asphalt materials which tend to whistle in high winds.</p>

            <h2>There are many different styles available for any style of house!</h2>
            <p>A metal roof is a great addition to any home. Not only do they look great and feature a warm, weathered aesthetic that can spruce up almost any style of the house, but they provide amazing protection against the elements as well.
